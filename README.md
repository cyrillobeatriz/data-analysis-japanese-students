# Analyzing University Students' Mental Health

A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. The study also indicated that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

I used this data to answer the following questions:

Is the length of stay a contributing factor?
Is gender related to a higher risk of mental illness?
Is religion related to better indicators/metrics?


# Answering the questions
## 1. Is the length o the stay a contributing factor?
- The numbers show us that the more years the student spends, the higher their score on the PHQ test (depression).
- The score of social connectedness (SCS test) decreases as the student spends more years at the university.
- Acculturative stress (ASISS test) also decreases over the years.

## 2. Is gender related to a higher risk of mental illness?

Yes, the data shows that women are more likely to experience mental health difficulties than men

## 3. Is religion related to better metrics?

The data shows that individuals who do not follow a religion have higher scores on the PHQ-9 test and the acculturative stress test.
Conversely, individuals who follow a religion have a higher score on the social connectedness test, suggesting that religion may be a positive factor in this context.
