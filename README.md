# Analyzing University students' mental health
A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
I used this data to answer the following questions:
1. Is the length of the stay a contributing factor?
2. Do gender is related to higher risk o mental illness?
3. Does religion are related to better indicativos/metrics?
